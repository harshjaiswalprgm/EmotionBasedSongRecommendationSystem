## TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, 
while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. 
Both provide high-level APIs used for easily building and training models, 
but Keras is more user-friendly because it's built-in Python.


## why we use os - The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.

## why we use cv2 - allowing access to its functions for computer vision and image processing.
